# API for desktop recording

If you’re looking for a hosted desktop recording API, consider checking out [Recall.ai](https://www.recall.ai/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_campaign=pensieve), an API that records Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, In-person meetings, and more.

Pensieve is a local-only desktop app for recording meetings, discussions, memos or other audio
snippets from locally running applications for you to always go back and review your
previous discussions.

It uses a bundled Whisper instance to transcribe the audio locally, and optionally
summarizes the transcriptions with an LLM. You can connect a local Ollama instance to
be used for summarization, or provide an OpenAI key and have ChatGPT summarize the
transcriptions for you.

If you choose Ollama for summarization (or disable summarization entirely), all your
data stays on your machine and is never sent to any external service. You can record
as many meetings as you want, and manage your data yourself without any external
providers involved.

Pensieve automatically registers a tray icon and runs in the background, which
makes it easy to start and stop recordings at any time. You can also configure
Pensieve in many ways, like customizing which models to use for transcription
and summarization, or various audio processing settings.

# MacOS Setup Notes

Pensieve requires FFmpeg and Whisper to be installed on macOS. The easiest way to install these dependencies is using Homebrew:

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Homebrew** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. **Install FFmpeg**:
   ```bash
   brew install ffmpeg
   ```

3. **Install Whisper**:
   ```bash
   brew install whisper-cpp
   ```

### Verification

After installation, verify that both tools are available:

```bash
ffmpeg -version
whisper-cpp --help
```

### Alternative Installation Methods

If you prefer not to use Homebrew:

- **FFmpeg**: Download from [https://ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
- **Whisper**: Download from [https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp)

### Opening the App After Download

After downloading Pensieve from the releases page, you may see a message that the app is "damaged" when trying to open it. This is due to macOS Gatekeeper's quarantine feature for apps downloaded from the internet.

**Using the DMG Installer Helper (Recommended):**

When you open the Pensieve DMG, you'll see a "Pensieve Installer.app" helper:
1. Double-click "Pensieve Installer.app" (you may need to right-click it the first time and select "Open")
2. The helper will automatically:
   - Copy Pensieve.app to your Applications folder
   - Remove the quarantine attribute
   - Optionally open Pensieve for you
3. You can then open Pensieve normally from Applications anytime

**Alternative: Manual Method**

If you prefer not to use the helper, after moving Pensieve to Applications, open Terminal and run:
```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Pensieve.app
```

### Troubleshooting

If Pensieve shows warning dialogs about missing dependencies:
1. Ensure the tools are installed and available in your PATH
2. Restart Pensieve after installation
3. Check that the tools are accessible from the terminal
